# swift-locations

A wrapper on the CoreLocation framework replacing the delegate pattern with Swift concurrency.

## Overview

CoreLocation reports a device's location, altitude and orientation from on-device components.

## Availability

- iOS 13.0+
- iPadOS 13.0+
- macCatalyst 15.0+
- macOS 10.15+
- watchOS 6.0+

## Installation

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

1. Add the package to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file.

    ```swift
    let package: Package = .init(
        ...
        dependencies: [
            .package(url: "https://github.com/alexandrehsaad/swift-locations.git", branch: "main")
        ],
        ...
    )
    ```

2. Add the package as a dependency on your target in your `Package.swift` file.

    ```swift
    let package: Package = .init(
        ...
        targets: [
            .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
                .product(name: "Locations", package: "swift-locations")
            ]),
        ],
        ...
    )
    ```

3. Import the package in your source code.

    ```swift
    import Locations
    ```

## Demonstration

1. Initiate the locater with your desired accuracy.

    ```swift
    let locater: Locater = .init(accuracy: .tenMetres)
    ```

2. Request the userâ€™s permission to use location services and do something with the asynchronous value you receive. You can not show to the user an authorization dialog twice, but you can show the steps to change the permission from Settings.

    ```swift
    do {
        let status: AuthorizationStatus = try await locater.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
		// Do something with the status.
        print(status)
    } catch let error {
        // Do something with the error.
        print(error)
    }
    ```

3. Subscribe to the locater and do something with the asynchronous stream of values you receive. The return type is `Point`, which conforms to a new protocol `PlottableInTwoDimensions`.

    ```swift
    do {
        let stream: AsyncStream<CLLocation> = try locater.subscribe()
        for await data in stream {
            // Do something with the data.
            print(data)
        }
    } catch let error {
        // Do something with the error.
        print(error)
    }
    ```

4. Unsubscribe from the locater.

    ```swift
    locater.unsubscribe()
    ```

### Troubleshooting common errors

Your app must include usage description keys in its `Info.plist` file for the types of data it needs. Failure to include these keys cause the app to crash. To access location data specifically, it must include either `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` or `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`.
